Organize media into YEAR/MONTH/DAY folders using Exif data, file properties, name, etc.

Wrote this little app a few years ago when I got tired of organizing media every time I downloaded all the images and videos from my phone or my wifes phone. I run this on a little Linux box that acts as my NAS. I just drop files into an import folder and on a given interval, this process scans the folder, picks up any new files and puts them into the appropriate media folder I've selected. While moving files, it renames them to a meaningfull date format and appends a counter for multiple images in a day.
